# Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec template

This is a template based on the Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec book by Aaron Sumner.
 **Pull requests are welcome.**

## How to Use

```bash
rails new [app_name] -m https://raw.github.com/antoniorosado/everydayrailsrspec-template/master/template.rb -T
```

## TODO
I'm not convinced on the sed part of the template. It doesn't feel right at all.
I appreciate any help on improving this template.
Thanks :)
